- Reason for multi-containers is to group up containers that rely or need each other.
- Multi-container pods,
	- Share network space (can refer to each other as localhosts).  
	- Have access to same storage volume.
	- NO NEED TO ESTABLISH VOLUME SHARING OR CREATING SERVICES.
- Design Patterns in multi-container pods. For examples read [this](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns/):
	- Ambassador - Ambassador containers proxy a local connection to the world.
	- Adapter - Adapter containers standardize and normalize output.
	- Sidecar - Sidecar containers extend and enhance the "main" container, they take existing containers and make them better. Sidecar containers in K8s are `initContainers` with `restartPolicy: Always`.
- Breaking up large monolithic application into sub components is known as Microservices.
