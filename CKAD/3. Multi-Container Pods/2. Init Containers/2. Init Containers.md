- A container that executes a task when the pod is created Or a process that waits for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts.
- Unlike Sidecar the container terminates when its task is completed and doesn't follow the POD's lifecycle.
- You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-pod containers. In that case each init container is run **one at a time in sequential order**.
