- Create a service account, `kubectl create serviceaccount <account name>`
	- Service Account Token are generated automatically upon creation of a service account. This token is used by the external application to authenticate to Kubernetes API.
		- The token generated is an authentication bearer token to interact with the REST API.
		- Token is stored within a secret object.
- Retrieve service accounts, `kubectl get serviceaccounts`
	- Each namespace in Kubernetes has a `default` service account.
		- When creating a Pod the token for the `default` service account is used to authenticate and so it is mounted to the pod.
		- `default` service account can only run basic Kubernetes API queries.
- To change service accounts used by a Pod, deletion and recreation is required,
## v1.22 and v1.24
- In version 1.22, TokenRequestAPI was introduced which generated tokens that are,
	- Audience Bound
	- Time Bound
	- Object Bound
- When Pod is created, no longer relies on Server Account's secret token. Instead a token with a defined lifetime is generated and mounted as a projected volume within the Pod.
- In v1.24, change to creation of service account token was made. Service account creation was separated from token generation. Requiring users to create a token for a service account (`kubectl create token <service account name>`) if needed, which is not stored as a secret.
