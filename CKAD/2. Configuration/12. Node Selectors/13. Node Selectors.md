- Can be used to select nodes upon which Pods can be deployed using the node labels.
- Uses the label on the nodes to select where the Pods should be deployed via `nodeSelector`.
- Can only be performed on the Pod level.
## Label Nodes 
- `kubectl label nodes <node name> <label-key>=<label-value>`

For more complex conditional node selection `NodeAffinity` can be used.
