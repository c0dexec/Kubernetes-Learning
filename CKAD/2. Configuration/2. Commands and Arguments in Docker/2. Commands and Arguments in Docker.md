- `CMD` gets overwritten if a command is passed via `docker run`. For example here, `docker run ubuntu echo 1` will over write the `CMD` portion of `ubuntu` with the command `echo 1`
- To persist the overwriting of `CMD` command create a `Dockerfile` with using Ubuntu and specify your custom `CMD`.
- `ENTRYPOINT` instruction specifies the program/script that will be ran in the container. Anything passed with `docker run` will be the argument appended to the program/script `ENTRYPOINT` instruction runs.
	- To specify a default value to the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, use it along side with `CMD` where `ENTRYPOINT` is followed by `CMD` which appends the value to the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction.
	- `ENTRYPOINT` can be overwritten using `--entrypoint` flag within `docker run`.
