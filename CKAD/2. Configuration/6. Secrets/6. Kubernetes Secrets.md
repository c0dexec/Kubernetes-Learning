- Are stored encoded. Therefore, don't push secrets to SCM.
- Secrets are not encrypted in ETCD.
	- Consider enabling encryption at rest.
- Anyone able to access a specific namespace can also access its secrets.
	- Have proper role-based access controls
- Consider third-party secrets store providers,
	- AWS Provider, Azure Provider, GCP, etc.
- Secret is only sent to a node if the pod on it requires it.
- Kubelet stores the secret into a tmpfs so that the secret is not written to disk storage.
# Commands
- Create a secret,
	- Imperative, `kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from--literal=<key>=<value>`
	- Declarative, `kubectl create secrets --from-file=<secret-file> `
		- Pass single or specific environment variable from ConfigMap within `env` pass in with `valueFrom`, Or
		- Inject the whole data as a file in a volume.
			- Each secret is created as a file within the container where the name is the `key` and data within the file is the `value`.
>[ ***Note:** Always remember to set the `-n` flag for `echo` when encoding secrets. The flag prevents trailing newline characters from being encoded. Hidden characters in base64 encoded secrets will result in improperly formed strings, which will cause you grief with Kubernetes.](https://www.cloudytuts.com/tutorials/kubernetes/how-to-base64-encode-kubernetes-secrets/)*
