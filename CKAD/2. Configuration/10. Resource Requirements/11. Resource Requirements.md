- `kube-scheduler` decides which node a Pod goes to based on the availability of resources.
	- If no nodes have resource available then Pod remains in a `Pending` state until the sufficient resources are available. 
## Resource Requests
-  Resources requested by Pod.
### CPU
- 1 CPU / 1000 mili (Mi) - 1 AWS vCPU, 1 GCP Core, 1 Azure Core, 1 Hyperthread.
### Memory
- Ki = 1024 bytes.
- K = 1000 bytes.
## Resource limits
- Limits can be set on containers to regulate consumption of resources
- A container cannot utilize more CPU than its limit, but it can utilize more memory than the specified limit.
	- If more memory than the limit is consumed then the Pod is terminated with "Out Of Memory" (OOM) error. 
	- The termination is done to free up memory being consumed by the Pod.

When a Pod has no limits set but requests are then, it would consume resources based on the needs

## LimitRange
- Can be used to specify a limit range for Pods created within a namespace without Limits being specified within the Pod definition.
- Applies to the whole namespace.
## Resource Quotas
- Resource Quotas sets a limit on resource for all pods and deployments within the namespace.
