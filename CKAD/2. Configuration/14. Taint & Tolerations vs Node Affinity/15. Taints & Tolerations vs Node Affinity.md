## Taint & Tolerations
- Taint and Tolerations don't guarantee that a Pod will reside on a Node with the configured tolerations and taint.
## Node Affinity
-  Has a chance that other Pods could end up running on the Node.

Combination of both can be used to completely dedicate Nodes for specific Pods. Use Taints and Tolerations to prevent other pods being placed on the Nodes and then use Node affinity to prevent our pods being placed on their nodes.
