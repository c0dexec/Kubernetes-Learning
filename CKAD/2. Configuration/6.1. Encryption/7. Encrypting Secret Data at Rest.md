 - Focus on how sensitive data is stored in ETCD server,
	 - Without encryption enabled data is stored in plaintext within ETCD.
- If `kube-apiserver` is running with `--encryption-provider-config` argument, then it means encryption at rest has been enabled.
	- Can use `ps -aux` to find the `kube-apiserver` and see the argument it is being executed with. OR
	- `kube-apiserver.yaml` within `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` can examined to see the current configuration of the `kube-apiserver`.
- [Enable encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#encrypting-your-data)
	- Will require creation of a base64 encoded secret key `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64` .
	- This is consumed by the config definition of `EncryptionConfiguration`.
	- Then the `kube-apiserver.yaml` need to be updated to have `--encryption-provider-config` enabled and the `EncryptionConfiguration` config definition mounted.
- Once encryption is enabled then any new secrets are encrypted. Older secrets are not encrypted unless they are modified. To encrypt all secrets use [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#ensure-all-secrets-are-encrypted).
