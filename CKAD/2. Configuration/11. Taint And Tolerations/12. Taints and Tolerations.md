- Used to help schedule Pods to Nodes.
- Taints are set on Nodes
- Tolerations are set on Pods
- Taints are used on Nodes and if it matches the Tolerations of a Pod then that specific Pod can reside in that Node. 
	- But it is not a grantee for the Pod to reside on the tolerated Node, as it can also reside on a Node without any taints.
	- To restrict a Pod to certain nodes NodeAffinity is used.
## Taints
- How to taint a Node
	- `kubectl taint nodes <node name> key=value:<taint-effect>`
		- Taint effects,
			- `NoSchedule` - Will not schedule Pod on the node.
			- `PreferNoSchedule` - Try to not placing the Pod on the Node.
			- `NoExecute` - New Pods will not be scheduled and existing Pods will be evicted if taint is not tolerated. 
## Tolerations  
- Tolerations can only be applied on a Node level.
- `spec.tolerations` is used to specify the taint values of the Node where the Pod needs to reside.
