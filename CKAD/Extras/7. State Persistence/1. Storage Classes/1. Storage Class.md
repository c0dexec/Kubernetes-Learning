- When working with Persistent Volumes on Cloud providers, the disk resource needs to be created before assigning it to a PV.
## Static Provisioning
- When a user has to manually provision a disk and then create a PV definition.
## Dynamic Provisioning
- Allow dynamic provisioning of PV and disk provisioning.
	- Meaning that no longer a PV definition file is required.
	- When a PVC is made the PV and disk are automatically provisioned.
- For Dynamic Provisioning to occur,
	- A Storage class should be present (a PV get created when Storage Class is created).
	- When a PVC can use it by specifying `persistentvolumeclaim.spec.storageClassName` value as the name of the Storage Class created.
	- Then the PVC can be mounted on the Pod as a `volume` and mounted into the container as one of the `volumeMounts`.

***Note: `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true` can be set to specify a default StorageClass. [How to change a default StorageClass?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/#changing-the-default-storageclass)***
