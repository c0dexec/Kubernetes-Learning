-  When Pod template has a PVC specified it would by default share the PVC amongst all the StatefulSet Pods.
- `Statefulset.spec.volumeClaimTemplates` can be used to resolve this.
	- `volumeClaimTemplates` create has a template of a PVC, this template is used by each Pod to create a new PVC which then uses the Storage class to provision a volume which then is used for the PV.
