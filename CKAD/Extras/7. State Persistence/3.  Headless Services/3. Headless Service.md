- A service type with no IP addresses. When calling upon this service via DNS, it provides the IP addresses assigned to the Pod directly (matching the Selector).

Performing a DNS queries,

```Services
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
headless-service   ClusterIP   None           <none>        80/TCP    29m
regular-service    ClusterIP   10.233.23.61   <none>        80/TCP    28m
```

```Pods
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-pod         1/1     Running   0          13m   app=headless-service
other-nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          25s   app=headless-service
tmp01             1/1     Running   0          20m   run=tmp01
```

```sh
# From an apline container

- [A more in depth explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52713482).
- In terms of DNS names, the topology is as follows:
	- `<podname>.<headless-servicename>.<namespace>.<svc>.<cluster-domain>.<example>`
		- If a Stateful set, then the name would be Sequential.
- In Headless service, DNS entries get created for Pods if two conditions are met while creating the Pod,
	- `Pods.spec.subdomain` is the same name as the Headless service name, this points name of the service to the Pod.
	- For A records to be generated `Pods.spec.hostname` is also required.
	- If the following steps are performed within a `Deployment` type replicas with the same A record will be generated.
	- To have sequential/unique naming usage of `StatefulSet` is required.
		- Also set `StatefulSet.spec.serviceName` to be the Headless service. It lets the Stateful Set know which Headless service is belongs to it.
