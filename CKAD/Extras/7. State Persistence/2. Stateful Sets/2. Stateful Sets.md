- Are similar to deployments, with the difference being,
	- Pods are created in a sequential order. Where once the Pods is in a ready and running state then next one is deployed.
	- Each Pod is given an a sequential number (starting from 0 and incrementing by 1).
		- Making the name of the Pods be,
			- `<name of StatefulSet>-<number assigned>`
	- This provides a sticky identity to Stateful Sets.
	- Pods are removed and deleted in a sequential order aswell. Starting first from the last Pod and going to 0.
- Sequential creation and deletion of Pods can be changed from an `OrderedReady` approach to be `Parallel`. This is done by modifying the `StatefulSet.spec.podManagementPolicy` to be `Parallel`.
- Can be useful in cases when order of deployment or a stateful name is necessary.
	- Database replication.
- Stateful Set requires a Headless Service to be present.
