- When deployment is created a Deployment controller (built in) is responsible for creation of replica of Pods.
- Example of custom resources and each one of them have a controller,
	- ReplicaSet
	- Deployment
	- Job
	- CronJob 
	- StatefulSet 
	- Namespace 
- To allow creation of a custom resource, first a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file needs to be created.
- When a CRD is created and applied, then we are able to create our custom resource.
	- CRD resource is stored within `ETCD`, but nothing else is being perform for it until our custom controller is functionable.
- To delete a CRD and its resources, just deleting the CRD removes the resources automatically.
