- In Kubernetes 
	- `v1` - considered to be a GA (Generally Availability) stable version.

		- Newly developed API is merged to the Kubernetes code base and is part of the Kubernetes release for the first time.

- API group , can support multiple versions. For example, API Group `apps` can have API versions `v1`, `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1`. At the same time.
	- A deployment can be created with any of these API versions. But only one preferred/storage API version will be used.
		- Preferred version, version used to call upon the resource when using `kubectl` command. This version can be found by calling upon the API group.
			- Using `curl` and `kubectl proxy` (to authenticate without extracting certificates)
		- Storage version, stable version to which API object gets converted to regardless of what was mentioned in the YAML file, before storing it into ETCD. To view the storage version in use, `etcdctl` client can be used to check the version of currently storage API object type.

```yaml
{
  "kind": "APIGroup",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "name": "apps",
  "versions": [
    {
      "groupVersion": "apps/v1",
      "version": "v1"
    }
  ],
  "preferredVersion": {
    "groupVersion": "apps/v1",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}
```
## Enabling/Disabling API groups
- API groups can be toggled by changing the configuration in `kube-apiserver` runtime.
	- Adding a `runtime-config` parameter where API group and version can be specified. For example for API Group `batch` and API Version `batch/v2alpha1`, `--runtime-config=batch/v2alpha1`.
