 Types of Admission Controllers:
 1. Validating Admission Controller - Validates a request to allow or deny it.
 2. Mutating Admission Controller - Changes or modifies and object.
Mutating controllers may modify objects related to the requests they admit; validating controllers may not.[[1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-are-they)]
Some Admission controllers can perform both tasks as well. Usually the admission controllers perform mutation first and then validation.

## Custom Admission Controllers
- `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`
- Pointed to a server hosting the Admission Webhook either in Kubernetes server or externally.
- Server runs the webhook with custom code and logic required.
