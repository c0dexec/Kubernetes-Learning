## Pod Condition
- The use of Readiness probes is to provide an accurate status of the Pod and prevent disruption of service to the users.
- When a Pod's condition reports a "Ready" status Kubernetes assumes it is ready to receive user traffic. Therefore, it start to route traffic to the Pod.
	-  Therefore, tests or probes can be set to serve a more accurate "Ready" status.
		- API response for HTTP,
		- TCP socket for Database,
		- Or a script which exits when the application hits a ready state.
