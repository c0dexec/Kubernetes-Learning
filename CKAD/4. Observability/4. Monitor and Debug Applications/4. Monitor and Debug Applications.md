- Can monitor node or pods level metrics such as performance.
## Metrics Server
- `cAdvisory` (container advisor) within `kubelet` is responsible for retrieving performance metrics from Pods. Then uses Kubelet API to send them across to the Metrics Server.
- Previously known as Heapster.
- Stores metrics within the memory and not on the disk.
	- Cannot be used for historical performance data.
***Note**: CKAD focuses on Metrics Server.*
