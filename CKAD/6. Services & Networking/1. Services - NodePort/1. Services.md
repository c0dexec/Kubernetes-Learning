- Enable communication within and outside of the application. Helps connect applications with other applications or users.
- Services allow connectivity between different applications (group of pods).
	- The service also acts as a Load Balancer.
	- Has DNS associated to the service which is used to access the backend application.
## Type of Services
- NodePort - Listens on the Node and forwards the traffic to the Port exposed for communicating with the Pod.
	- TargetPort - Port on the Pod where application is running. If not provided it default to Port.
	- Port - Port for the service where the NodePort send the traffic to. 
	- NodePort - Port that is exposed on the Node. Is between range of 30,000 to 32,767.
	- A NodePort service has its own IP address.
	- If `selector` finds matching labels for one or more Pod. Then it applied to all the Pods and automatically load balances.
	- When service is created it span between all the Nodes, so if Pods exist on different Nodes, the service still gets applied.
- ClusterIP - Creates a virtual IP inside a cluster to enable communication between different services.
- LoadBalancer - Provisions a load balancer in supported cloud providers. For example, This can be used to distribute web traffic across the web servers in your front-end tier.
