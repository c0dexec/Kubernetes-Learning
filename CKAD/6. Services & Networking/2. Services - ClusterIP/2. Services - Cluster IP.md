- Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a `type` for a Service. You can expose the Service to the public internet using an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) or a [Gateway](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/).
