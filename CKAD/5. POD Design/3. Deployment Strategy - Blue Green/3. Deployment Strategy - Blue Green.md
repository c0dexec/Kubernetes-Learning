- Not a typical strategy present in Kubernetes but can be implemented.
- Blue and Green environments are present where Blue and Green alternate the latest versions between each other.
	- Currently the load balancer will be pointing to the old environment. For example lets say Blue is on v1 and Green on v2. 
	- When the tests (QA checks) have passed then load balancer switches over to Green being v2.
	- In the next cycle Blue will be v3 and Green will remain v2. And so on.
## Kubernetes Implementation
- Two deployments are created named Blue and Green.
- A service is also created to route the traffic to the deployments.
- Both deployments have a version labeled to them. For example Blue is "version: v1" and Green is "version: v2".
- The service has a Selector which looks for "version: v1". When tests have been passed then the Selector is modified to look for "version: v2" routing traffic to Green deployment.
