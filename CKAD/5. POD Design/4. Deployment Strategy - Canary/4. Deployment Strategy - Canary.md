- Deploy new version but only route small percentage of traffic to it.
	- Then tests are ran.
	- When tests are successful then older version are upgrade (for example using rolling upgrade strategy).
	- Then the Canary deployment is removed.
## Kubernetes Implementation
- Create two deployments Primary (v1) and Canary (v2).
- Create a Service used to route traffic.
- When deployment has been tested, we upgrade Primary deployment's version and delete Canary deployment.
### Route traffic to both versions
- Set a common label to both Primary and Canary deployments. For example `app: front-end` label is set to both.
### Route a small percentage of traffic to Version 2
- Scaling down the Pods in Canary deployments to 1 will route small percentage of traffic.
- If Primary has 5 Pods and Canary had 5 Pods. Then traffic distribution is 50%. When the Canary replica's are set to 1 Pod. Then the traffic distribution changes to 1 Pod out of 6 (Pods from Primary and Canary). $\frac{1}{6} = 0.17$
