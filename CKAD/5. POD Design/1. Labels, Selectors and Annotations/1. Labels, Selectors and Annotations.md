#### Filtering labels
- When filtering labels [equality-based or set-based selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) can be used. [How to use them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#list-and-watch-filtering).
