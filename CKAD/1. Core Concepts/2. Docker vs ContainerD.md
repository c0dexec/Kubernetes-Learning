- Open Container Initiative(OCI) standards,
	- How an image is build (`imagespec`),
	- How a container runtime should be developed (`runtimespec`)
- If a container solution follows these then it is compatible with Kubernetes's Container Runtime Interface(CRI)
- Docker was created before OCI standards (underlying runs ContainerD),
	- Kubernetes created a solution called `dockershim` 
	- Because solution was harder to manager by Kubernetes in version 1.24 of Kubernetes support was dropped
	- Images built by Docker work as it follow `imagespec` OCI standards
## CLI
### ctr
- The use of `ctr` is to debug containers and should not be used to manage container in production environments.
- Works only in containerd
	- To pull an image
```
$ ctr images pull docker.io/library/redis:alpha
```
Read man pages for `ctr` if need to know more.
### nerdctl
- Docker like CLI
- Supports docker compose
- Also gives access to other newer features that are not available in Docker yet.
- Works only in containerd
### crictl
- Used to interact with CRI compatible container runtime, so works with all supported container runtimes.
- Developed and maintained by Kubernetes
- Not user friendly
	- Meant for container debugging.
- Works closely with `kubelet`
- To setup read this, [Debugging Kubernetes nodes with crictl | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/crictl/#general-usage)
- Needs to be installed separately
```bash
$ crictl pull busybox
$ crictl images
$ crictl ps -a
$ crictl exec -i -t {container id} ls
$ crictl logs {container id}
$ crictl pods
```
