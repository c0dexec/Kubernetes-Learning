Deployments give us the ability to,
- Deploying multiple instances of services,
- Upgrading image versions of services,
- Perform rolling updates to reduce downtime,
- Role back changes,
- Maintenance windows to pause and resume once changes have been performed.
## Hierarchy
[Highest to Lowest in terms of complexity]
1. Deployments contain Replica Sets,
2. Replica Sets manage the replication of instances of Pods,
3. Pods contains the container(s),
4. Containers have the image of the service being provided.
## Definition
- Definition file is similar to a Replica Set's.
- The deployment automatically creates a replica set.

A **rolling update** allows a Deployment update to take place with zero downtime. It does this by incrementally replacing the current Pods with new ones. The new Pods are scheduled on Nodes with available resources, and Kubernetes waits for those new Pods to start before removing the old Pods. [[6. Recap - Deployments#^9736ed]]
