- Node (previously a.k.a Minions)
	- Worker machine with Kubernetes installed.
- Cluster is a group of nodes
- Master is a node
	- Master machine with Kubernetes installed
	- Is responsible for orchestration of containers within the cluster's worker nodes
- Components in Kubernetes installation
	- API Server - Front end, interacts with devices, cli
	- etcd - Key-value store containing cluster information. Based on `etcd` framework.
	- Scheduler - Responsible for scheduling containers to nodes.
	- Controller - Responsible for responding (by spinning up) when containers, nodes, endpoints have downtime.
	- Container Runtime - Underlying software use to run containers.
	- kubelet - An agent running on each node of the cluster. Responsible to ensure containers run on nodes as expected.

Difference between Master and Worker Nodes,

| Components                   | Master Node | Worker Node |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Container Runtime            | ❌           | ✅           |
| API server (kube-apiserverl) | ✅           | ❌           |
| kubelet                      | ❌           | ✅           |
| etcd                         | ✅           | ❌           |
| Controller                   | ✅           | ❌           |
| Scheduler                    | ✅           | ❌           |
