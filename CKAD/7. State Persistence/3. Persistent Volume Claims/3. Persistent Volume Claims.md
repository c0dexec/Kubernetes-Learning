- Persistent Volume Claims are made to Persistent Volumes and bound based on the properties set.
- Each claim can only be bound to a single volume. Meaning no other Persistent Volume Claim can use it.
- If `selector` is not specified, Kubernetes bounds the most appropriate Persistent Volume based on,
	- Sufficient Capacity
	- Access Modes
	- Volume Modes
	- Storage Class
- If Kubernetes cannot find any other PV beside a large PV, then the PVC requesting a small size will get bound to it. The rest of the space in the PV will remain utilized.
- If not PV are available then a PVC stays in a pending state until newer PVs are added.
- When a PVC is deleted by default the data is retained (`persistentvolume.spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain`) . This mean PV will remain until deleted by the administrator and cannot be use by any PVC till then. ^persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy
	- Other options are,
		- `Delete` which deletes the PV and the data within it.
		- `Recycle` which cleans up the data within the PV and makes it available for other PVCs.
