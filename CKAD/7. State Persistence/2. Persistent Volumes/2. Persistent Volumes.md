- Unlike volumes, persistent volumes is a large block of storage.
	- This allows simplicity when managing volume over multiple Pods.
	- A pod can specifically carve out space (though Persistent Volume Claim) as needed from the Persistent Volume.

Note: `hostPath` field is not used in Production environment because it requires all nodes to have similar data within the path.

Note: Every `PersistentVolume` will have a `PersistentVolumeClaim` when in use.

## Access Modes Types
- [Persistent Volumes | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
## `persistentvolume.spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`
- The policies which are bound to a PV to determine what happens with the data when PV is being reclaimed, [[3. Persistent Volume Claims#^persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy]]
	- `Retain`
	- `Delete` 
	- `Recycle`
